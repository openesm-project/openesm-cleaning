# openESM Database Cleaning Code

This repository contains code for cleaning and preprocessing the [openesm Database](https://openesmdata.org). 
All cleaned datasets are available on our website. Due to sharing restrictions, we can only share the cleaning scripts
and the cleaned metadata here on GitHub. 

For further questions, please contact the openESM team.
